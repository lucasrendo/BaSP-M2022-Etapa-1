# Trackgenix S.A
The company Trackgenix SA provides software development services to other companies.
In the development of a web system which we will call "Trackgenix" that will facilitate the
registration of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team, we must start with the
HTML structure of the landing page of the system requested by the company.

## Usage
To enter the project index, download the entire project from the github repo. Both index and assets. Once downloaded, click on the index and it will open the project on the browser from the local file.

### Week 2
Development of the HTML strcuture for Trackgenix landing. The HTML file was create with the objective of replicating the previously designed Desktop landing screen on Figma. The priority was set on using elements so that the content has the best semantic structure as possible and on correct nesting and indentation.
Also, the necessary files to start the project were added: multimedia files and this README.

### Week 3
Styling of the landing page without the use of responsive tools putting the priority on the coding of reusable styles

### Week 4
Styling of the landing page starting with CSS from 0 to make it responsive across any viewport

### Week 5
JS fundamentals: this week's folder was filled with excercises to learn and practice the logic and syntax of JavaScript. Also the errors found in week's 4 CSS got fixed

### Week 6
Sign-up and Login pages created and connected with the landing page. JS code and DOM event Were added to validate fields of the form

### week 7
login and signup forms were connected to a server through fetch object. User input data was sent to the server through queryparams and using the server validations accesed through JSON objects the form gets processed to return one of the following errors 
- the data is correct and the log in or sign up is successful
- user input format is incorrect in one or more fields
- bad request
- For the login there's an additional validation: if the input is correct but do not match an existing user it shows another error indicating that either the password or email is incorrect
Once the validations are completed and the format is correct the data gets stored in the browser local storage for further reutilization
